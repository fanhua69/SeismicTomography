# SeismicTomography
Tomography of the complex mountains with seismic waves 1998-1999
The seismic waves are shot from one side of the mountain,
and recieved from the other side of the mountain, vice versa.
then I created a initiative velocity modle of the mountain, 
then I created a large seismic wave travelling time equtaion.
I implemented SIRT algorithm to resolve the over-determined equation group.
SIRT is an acronym for "Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Techniquse"

SIRT is a effective and fast iterative solution of sparse linear least-squares problems.
